# Sorting Program

This program takes a pre-existing array object and peforms the corresponding the function to manipulate the array object. The program will perform bubble sort on the array object to sort it in ascending order. The program will then perform selection sort on an array object to sort it in descending order. A swap elements function is implemented to make the program more efficient.

This program demonstrates the ability to utilize functions to make a program more efficient. The program showcases how to perform bubble sort and selection sort which are two fundamental sorting methods.
